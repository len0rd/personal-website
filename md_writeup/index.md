# Welcome to DataLab's ByOwner

Welcome to the documentation for the Data Laboratory ByOwner project. The purpose of this project is to provide quality real estate data through superior automation technologies. The project is built with java and [screen-scraper](https://www.screen-scraper.com). Data is collected daily from hundreds of sites across North America, sent through rigorous processing, and finally shipped to the end-user.

The DataLab java project contains all proprietary java code developed by DataLab and is used throughout the entire [ByOwner process](process-structure/overview.md). The following is the javadocs site created for anyone looking to get familiar with/modify the code:
