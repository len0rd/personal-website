## Instructions

1. Bake potatoes as you would normally. When they are done, cut in half the long way. Scoop out the white part and put in a mixer bowl. Be careful not to cut into the skin. Put skins on a cookie sheet.
2. Mix the potatoes, milk (adding just a little at a time), salt, pepper, and butter. Mix until all the lumps are out of the potatoes.
3. Add the sour cream. Mix it in. Add the onions and mix slightly, only to mix in.
4. Grate or shred cheddar
5. Fill potato shells with mashed potatoes. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake at 400 for 20 minutes or until filling is golden.
